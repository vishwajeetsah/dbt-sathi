## 📋 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement ID 25059 — SIH 2025**  
> “Enhancing Student Awareness on the difference between Aadhaar-linked and Direct Beneficiary Transfer (DBT)-enabled Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts.”

The **SCD-V Division, DoSJE** implements centrally sponsored **Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Schemes**. These funds are directly transferred only to **DBT-enabled Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts**.  

However, a large number of students are **unaware of the distinction** between simple Aadhaar linking and DBT-enabled seeding, leading to delays, failed payments, and financial stress.
